# Contributing guidelins
When you want to add a new technology best practices, please follow the following guide.
1. Create a new branch from main
2. Create a new file for the tech stack you want to document for
3. Link to any official best practice documentation, before adding your own.
4. Use markdown for the content.
5. One technology must have only one file at the root level. Consolidate all things under a single file or create sub-folder for that tech and link the appropriate files in the main file and in readme.
6. Update the document, and create a link to your document in the [README.md](README.md) file and submit a pull-request to main.
7. If you want to update an existing tech-stack, follow the same PR model.
8. Do not modify/push things directly to main.
